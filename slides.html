#### The story of building a culture

### Description of the components for DX
### Hits and misses
### Outline of how to start

# Origin Story

I don't come to this as creator or even original thought leader. I stand
on the shoulders of giants. But I feel there are some nuances I learned
that are important to share.

# We'll do it live ...

We started pretty much right away and didn't plan all of it up front.

- Top down approval with immediate action - sort of
- Started with hiring interns and creating a DX team
- Interns allowed us to practice
- But it was production level projects - not "proof of concept"

---
# Something was missing

We started organizationally, and operationally, but we didn't yet have
a thing with a "name".

- Noone could articulate what exactly it was
- Noone had stopped to call it a name and give it a description

# DX culture

### 5 words we deem important
- Trust
- Honesty
- Simplicity
- Forgiveness
- Empathy

---

# DX philosophy

- "I don't know" is first in every conversation
- Empathize before educating
- Simplest thing that works today
- Architecture is always JIT

##### There were more but these were the winners

---

# Trust
- Deploy everyday - anything visual
- Solve something for the user
  - The user might be project manager seeing stories being delivered
- Completely and thoroughly communicate complexities
  - Tell how you've removed them
  - Tell how you're encountering them
  - Tell how you're working around them

---

# Empathy

- Always stop to think when you feel defensive
- It's never about you
- It's never (ever) about using React vs. Angular
  - Sometimes developers oppose due to FUD or uncertainty in themselves
- Do more than listen: Agree with your opposition on at least 2 things

---

# Honesty

- Everyday admit to not knowing
- Everyday allow yesterday's work to be dismissed, deleted and forgotten
- Allow others to be honest (don't resort to anger, frustration etc)

---

# Simplicity

- If the user doesn't see it nobody cares
- Architecture only matters after you prove there is a problem
- Nothing lasts forever so design for "throwawayability"

---

# Forgiveness

- You are human
- So are your co-workers
- Get over yourself

---

# Extreme Programming

- Best paradigm for honest, empathetic development
- Quickest path to building trust
- Simplicity is built-in

---

# Pair Programming

- Immediate education system
  - onboarding is hours not days
  - knowledge gaps shrink

---

# TDD

- Most effective way to trust ... yourself
- Deliverying everyday is a no consequence decision

---

# Balanced teams
- We called it the "triangle"
  - Product "When"
  - Design "What"
  - Development "How"

---

# Everyone loved it!
### And it all clicked immediately!
Not totally ...
- Took a while for devs to believe it
- Took a while for product/design/management to trust it
- If there isn't a daily cadence to delivery, there will never be trust
- Engineers/Developers - DON'T PANIC!
- We fought over branching/merging the most and it was never the problem
  - Red herring for other problems
  - Release times led to collisions (monolith problem)
  - Feature work let to collisions (prioritization problem)
---

# If I started today ...

#### Step 1: Commit to repeating myself everyday for the forseeable future
#### Step 2: Negotiate with management for "proof of effectiveness"
#### Step 3: Silence is never acceptance - get feedback immediately
#### Step 4: Absolutely and unequivocally know your whole IT org

---

# First team, first activity

## Team
- at a minimum 1 pair
- don't fall for the "must be senior" fallacy

## Activity
- can be as simple as 1 feature
- does not have to be user-facing deliverable
- don't conflate re-write/refactor
- provide value - don't "proof of concept"

---

# Transparency all the way
- setup communication immediately (Slack duh?)
- educate everyone on the process/progress
- if outside stakeholders don't understand - forget it

---

# Final Thoughts

- Software is never done
- Nothing lasts forever
- The 5 words are hard - but the most rewarding part
