# Development Experience
#### The story of building a culture

---
# Topics
### Description of the components for DX
### Hits and misses
### Outline of how to start
---

# Origin Story

- David Dollar
  - https://www.heavybit.com/library/video/developer-experience-design/
- Pivotal Labs
  - CSAA Insurance Group mobile application development project

---

# We'll do it live ...

- Top down approval with immediate action - sort of
- Started with hiring interns and creating a DX team
- Interns allowed us to "practice"

---

# DX culture

### 5 words we deem important
- Trust
- Honesty
- Simplicity
- Forgiveness
- Empathy

---

# DX philosophy

- "I don't know" is first
- Empathize before educating
- Simplest thing that works today

##### There were more but these were the winners

---

# Everyone loved it!
### And it all clicked immediately!
Not totally ...
- Took a while for devs to believe it
- Took a while for product/design/management to trust it

---

# Trust
- Deploy everyday - anything visual
- Solve something for the user
  - The user might be project manager seeing stories being delivered
- Completely and thoroughly communicate complexities
  - Tell how you've removed them
  - Tell how you're encountering them
  - Tell how you're working around them
- Engineers/Developers - DON'T PANIC!

#### If there isn't a daily cadence to delivery, there will never be trust

---

# Empathy

- Always stop to think when you feel defensive
- It's never about you
- It's never (ever) about using React vs. Angular
- Do more than listen: Agree with your opposition on at least 2 things

---

# Honesty

- Everyday admit to not knowing
- Everyday allow yesterday's work to be dismissed, deleted and forgotten
- Allow others to be honest (don't resort to anger, frustration etc)

---

# Simplicity

- If the user doesn't see it nobody cares
- Architecture only matters after you prove there is a problem
- Nothing lasts forever so design for "throwawayability"

---

# Forgiveness

- You are human
- So are your co-workers
- Get over yourself

---

# Extreme Programming

- Best paradigm for honest, empathetic development
- Quickest path to building trust
- Simplicity is built-in

---

# Pair Programming

- Immediate education system
  - onboarding is hours not days
  - knowledge gaps shrink
