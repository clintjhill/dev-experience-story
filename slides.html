      # Development Experience
      #### The story of building a culture

      ---

      # Origin Story
      In the spring of 2015, CSAA Insurance Group's Digital Services team decided to
      make a dramatic shift in it's culture, processes and development team.

      This culture would be shaped for **Developer Experience**.

      # We'll do it live!!

      We started pretty much right away and didn't plan any of it up front.

      - Top down approval with immediate action - sort of
        - It was mostly just a Digital thing, the rest of the company was in the dark
        - This caused problems later
      - Started with hiring interns and creating a *Development Experience* team
      - Interns allowed us to practice
      - It was production level projects - not "proof of concept"

      ---
      # Something was missing

      We started organizationally, and operationally, but ...

      - No one could articulate what exactly it was
      - No one had stopped to call it a name and give it a description

      ---

      # "What's your culture like?"

      # DX culture

      ### 5 words we deem important
      - Trust
      - Honesty
      - Simplicity
      - Forgiveness
      - Empathy

      ---

      # DX philosophy

      - "I don't know" is first position in every interaction
      - Empathize before educating
      - Simplest thing that works today
      - Architecture is always JIT

      ---

      # eXtreme Programming

      - Best paradigm for honest, empathetic development
      - Quickest path to building trust
      - Simplicity is built-in

      ---

      # Pair Programming

      - Immediate education system
        - on-boarding is hours not days
        - knowledge gaps shrink
      - Bad ideas die fast

      ---

      # TDD

      - Most effective way to trust ... yourself
      - Deliverying everyday is a no consequence decision
      - Take the religion out and the effect becomes stronger
      - "show me it works"
      - TDD increases the ability to change later without consequence

      _ consequences will deflate confidence _
      ---

      # Balanced teams
      - We called it the "triangle"
        - Product "When"
        - Design "What"
        - Development "How"
        - The user is always in the center of the triangle

      ---

      # Everyone loved it!

      Not entirely ...

      - Took a while for devs to believe it
      - Took a while for product/design/management to trust it
      - Developers panicked in a bunch of cases unnecessarily

      ---

      # Day to day change is hard

      - Daily delivery was harder than anticipated (technically, organizationally)
      - We fought over branching/merging the most and it was *never the problem*
        - Release times led to collisions (monolith problem)
        - Feature work led to collisions (prioritization problem)

      ---

      # Humans are complicated creatures

      - Lack of trust that everyone is doing their best
      - Lack of honesty about confidence to do work against expectations
      - Forgetting that this stuff is really hard

      ---

      # Retro? Too busy avoiding mistakes.
      - Over estimating that "experts" could solve this quickly
      - Never totally *correctly* handled failures (deadlines, goals etc)
      - Still stuck on "prevent failure" vs. "fix failure fast"

      ---

      # If I started today ...

      - Commit to repeating myself everyday

      ---
      # Other do-overs

      - Negotiate with management for *proof of effectiveness*
        - How do they measure success?
      - Silence is never acceptance - get feedback immediately
      - Absolutely and unequivocally know your whole IT org

      ---

      ## How do you do it?

      - Acknowledge that not all of this is cookie-cutter
      - Developers must have input to change

      ... but here is an outline ...

      ---

      # First team, first activity

      ## Team
      - at a minimum 1 pair
        - dev/dev or dev/design or dev/product
        - always a dev
      - don't fall for the "must be senior" fallacy
      - include skeptics (requirement)

      ## Activity
      - can be a simple feature or a whole product
      - should be user-facing deliverable
      - don't conflate with re-write/refactor
      - provide value - don't "proof of concept"

      ---

      # Transparency all the way
      - setup communication immediately
      - educate everyone on the process/progress
      - if outside stakeholders don't understand - you will lose
        - read: proof of effectiveness

      ---

      # Trust

      ### How to build it
      - Deploy everyday - everything visual and anything else
      - Completely and thoroughly communicate complexities
        - Tell how you've removed them
        - Tell how you're encountering them or ignoring them

      ### How to use
      - Don't over think requests (just start work)
      - Be a part of the design, not the *authority*

      Resolve trust issues with this question: *"What's best for the user?"*

      ---

      # Empathy

      ### How to build it
      - Be more honest about your feelings
      - Imagine everyone is your favorite elder
      - Never lie about your confidence to do new things
      - Have faith that others feel the same way

      ### How to use it
      - Always stop when you feel defensive
        - It's never about you
        - It's never (ever) about using React vs. Angular
      - Do more than listen: Agree with your opposition on at least 2 things

      ---

      # Honesty

      ### How to build it
      - Ask emotion questions
        - "how do you feel about this"
        - "does this make you nervous"
        - "are you disappointed about this"
      - Admit your own feelings

      ## How to use it
      - Everyday admit to not knowing something (out loud)
      - Allow yesterday's work to be dismissed, deleted and forgotten
      - Allow others to be honest (don't resort to anger, frustration etc)

      ---

      # Simplicity

      ### Simple rules about simplicity:
      - If the user doesn't benefit from it nobody cares
      - Architecture only matters after you *prove* there is a problem
      - Nothing lasts forever so design for "throw-away-ability"
        - the new TDD!

      ---

      # Forgiveness

      - You are human
      - So are your co-workers
      - Get over yourself
      - Let go of past grievances

      ---

      # Final Thoughts

      - Software is never done
      - Nothing lasts forever
        - Even cultures like this!
      - The 5 words are hard - but the most rewarding part
