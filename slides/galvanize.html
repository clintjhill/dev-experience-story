# Development Experience (DX)
#### The story outside of the technology

---

# What exactly?
DX is a play on the official ISO Standard for UX:

https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9241:-210:ed-1:v1:en

In short:
>"a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service"

and:
>"includes all the users' emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use. ..."

DX would be:
>"a developers's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a API, library or tool"

# Software is not real
# Humans are complicated

- We often identify ourselves with our works
- Show me where the software is?
- Photoshop devs "own" the users artwork?
- Forgetting that this stuff is really hard
- We have feelings and emotions that conflict with logic and reason

---

# DX culture

### 5 words
- Trust
- Honesty
- Simplicity
- Forgiveness
- Empathy

---

# DX philosophy

- "I don't know" is first position in every interaction
- Empathize before educating
- Simplest thing that works today
- Architecture is always JIT (Just In Time)

---

# eXtreme Programming

- Best paradigm for honest, empathetic development
- Quickest path to building trust
- Simplicity is built-in

---

# Pair Programming

- Immediate education system
  - on-boarding is in hours not days
  - knowledge gaps shrink
- Bad ideas die fast

---

# TDD

- Most effective way to trust ... yourself
- Deliverying everyday is a no consequence decision
- Take the religion out and the effect becomes stronger
- "show me it works"
- TDD increases the ability to change later without consequence

*consequences will deflate confidence*

---

# Trust

### How to build it
- Deploy everyday - everything visual and anything else
- Completely and thoroughly communicate complexities
  - Tell how you've removed them
  - Tell how you're encountering them or ignoring them

### How to use
- Don't over think requests (just start work)
- Be a part of the design, not the *authority*

Resolve trust issues with this question: *"What's best for the user?"*

---

# Empathy

### How to build it
- Be more honest about your feelings
- Imagine everyone is your favorite elder
- Never lie about your confidence to do new things
- Have faith that others feel the same way

### How to use it
- Always stop when you feel defensive
  - It's never about you
  - It's never (ever) about using React vs. Angular
- Do more than listen: Agree with your opposition on at least 2 things

---

# Honesty

### How to build it
- Ask emotion questions
  - "how do you feel about this"
  - "does this make you nervous"
  - "are you disappointed about this"
- Admit your own feelings

## How to use it
- Everyday admit to not knowing something (out loud)
- Allow yesterday's work to be dismissed, deleted and forgotten
- Allow others to be honest (don't resort to anger, frustration etc)

---

# Simplicity

### Simple rules about simplicity:
- If the user doesn't benefit from it nobody cares
- Architecture only matters after you *prove* there is a problem
- Nothing lasts forever so design for "throw-away-ability"
  - the new TDD!

---

# Forgiveness

- You are human
- So are your co-workers
- Get over yourself
- Let go of past grievances

---

# Final Thoughts

- Software is never done
- Nothing lasts forever
- The 5 words are hard - but the most rewarding part
