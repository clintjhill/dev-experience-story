# "DX" Developer Experience

### _Software culture and philosophy_

---

# What exactly?

DX is a play on the official ISO Standard for UX (User Experience):

https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9241:-210:ed-1:v1:en

In short:

> "a person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service"

and:

> "includes all the users' emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, physical and psychological responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after use. ..."

---

# DX is this ...

> "a developer's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a API, library or tool"

--

About building software ... you are never really doing it alone.

--

So it's also this:

> " ... and interactions with others."

---

# Philosophy

It's important to continously strive to understand our work and our products through constant study and scientific methodology.

> "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems."

---

# DX philosophy

- "I don't know" is first position in every interaction (Socratic)
  - Zen mind, empty mind, beginners mind
    > "I don't know anything therefore I'm open to evertyhing"
- Empathize with the person or problem, observe and listen
- Simplest thing that works today
- Architecture is always JIT (Just Enough, Just In Time)

---

# eXtreme Programming

- Best paradigm for honest, empathetic development
- Quickest path to building trust
- Simplicity is built-in

# Culture

How we behave and treat problems (and each other) every day is reflective of our values.

> "Culture is the social behavior and norms found in human societies."

---

# DX culture

### 5 words

- Trust
- Honesty
- Simplicity
- Forgiveness
- Empathy

---

# Trust

Do as you say, with good-faith arguments, and biased to action.

### How to build it

- Deploy everyday - everything visual and anything else
- Don't contemplate mistakes, instead move to resolutions

### How to use it

- Don't over think (just start work)
- Be a part of the design, not the _authority_

---

# Empathy

Software is hard and people are complicated, so be sure to remind yourself of this before making judgements.

- Be honest about your feelings, don't make people guess
- Have faith that others feel the same way
- Do more than listen - find shared understanding
 
---

# Honesty

It's better to have clarity about how we are working together. Bad software comes from dishonesty.

Don't simply rely on policy or process when interacting with each other.

- "how do you feel about this"
- "does this make you nervous"
- "are you disappointed about this"
- Everyday admit to not knowing something (especially more experienced folks - out loud)
- Things change. Allow yesterday's work to be dismissed, deleted and forgotten
- Allow others to be honest, don't resort to anger, frustration etc.

# Simplicity

_Simple rules about simplicity_

- If the user doesn't benefit from it, question its value
- Architecture only matters after you _prove_ there is a _need_
- Nothing lasts forever so design for "throw-away-ability"

---

# Forgiveness

- You are human
- So are your co-workers
- Make space for growth
- Get over yourself

# Additonal Thoughts

---

### Humans are complicated

- We often identify ourselves with our works
- We have feelings and emotions that conflict with logic and reason
- We forget that this stuff is really hard

### Software is not real

- Show me where the software is?
- pulses of electricity ... on/off

**Software therefore is not our identity.**

---

# Final Thoughts

- Software is never done
- Nothing lasts forever
- Actions make reality
